        <h1>Abstract </h1>
        <p>Enormous oceans of today are the worldwide arteries of commerce and transportation, making maritime security an issue of fundamental importance. The issue at stake is that conventional approaches of identifying and tracking ships at sea often fail to keep up with the ever-changing conditions of the ocean. These restrictions threaten international commerce, security, and ecological equilibrium by making The countries more vulnerable to things like piracy, smuggling, illicit fishing, and pollution. Automatic Identification System (AIS) analytics are strengthened by a range of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms in our "Next-Gen Maritime Security" solution. Through the use of these methods, we are able to improve vessel identification, trajectory prediction, behavior grouping, vessel type classification, and anomaly detection. By doing so, we are able to prevent potential threats to maritime security from occurring, therefore protecting international shipping lanes, maritime workers, and marine ecosystems. Our novel strategy provides a solid answer to the problem of marine security in today's dynamic environment</p>
